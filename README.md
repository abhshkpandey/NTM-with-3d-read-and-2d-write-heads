# NTM-with-3d-read-and-2d-write-heads

This repository contains a TensorFlow implementation of the Neural Turing Machine (NTM). NTM is a type of neural network architecture that includes an external memory component that allows it to learn and perform tasks that involve sequential and memory-dependent processing.

## Model components

The implementation consists of two main parts:

1. **SharedReadWriteHeads:** A layer defining shared read and write heads for interacting with external memory.

2. **NTM (Neural Turing Machine):** A model containing shared read and write heads, a controller (2D LSTM) and an external memory matrix.

## Usage

To use the NTM model in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ``` bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ntm-model.git
   cd ntm-model
   ```

2. **Installation dependencies:**
   ``` bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Use in your project:**
   ```python
   from ntm_model import NTM, SharedReadWriteHeads
   import tensorflow as tf

   # Create an instance of NTM and use the user_interaction function
   # ... (see example_script.py for more details)
   ```

4. **Run the sample script:**
   ``` bash
   python example_script.py
   ```

## Additional information

For more details about the NTM model and its usage, see [example_script.py](example_script.py). This file shows how to work with the NTM model and how to get the relevant information.

Feel free to modify and integrate the NTM model into your projects as needed.
